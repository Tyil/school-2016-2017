Timaflu is a small company in the medicine sector. They have a large building in
order to grow, and they wish to start growing at this point in time. There are
some issues that prevent them from expanding. VTA2 is a group of students to
solve their problems so they can expand as per Timaflu's vision.
\\ \\
Currently, Timaflu is using paper documents for all internal communication and
processing orders from their customers. The customers place their orders using
phonecalls with Timaflu employees.
\\ \\
VTA2 has found that their current methods of using paper documents is their
biggest hurdle in expanding the company. Therefore it is advised to implement a
computer information system to handle these documents instead. This will allow
them to avoid a lot of the errors that may arise from using paper documents.
Adding to this, such a system can easily generate reports for the board of
directors at Timaflu.
\\ \\
As such, VTA2 will start on designing a database structure for this project. The
system will have to deal with all paper documents which are in use right now. It
must also be able to provide an overview of all processes and orders going on
and generate reports of the business.
